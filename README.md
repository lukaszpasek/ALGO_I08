Minimal circle containing  There are n points in the data plane. Determine the minimum radius of the circle that contains them all inside or out.  Entrance  The first line of the input containing the list with (1≤z≤2⋅109) - legalization, the descriptions of which are followed by the command. Description of one player on the account:  The first line shows the number of points 3≤n≤200000. The next n lines contain two real numbers, not exceeding the exceedances per module of 20000 - co-accessible points.  You can assume that no two points coincide.  Exit  For each data set, write one real one - the minimum radius of the containing circles, with an accuracy of 10-9.
